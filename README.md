Welcome to my DALL-E generate and share website. This repository was built primarily using Vite, React, Tailwind, MongoDB, Cloudinary, Express.js and of course the OpenAI API. The purpose of the site is to use the OpenAI API
to generate an image, pass it back to the database if the user would like to share their image, and then fetch from the database and display a share page on the home screen.
